# Shooter-Game
This is a simple shooter game made using C# and Visual Studio and also playing around with WPF for the first time

The idea of the game is to have the user shoot at enermy space ships. For every enemy the player takes down, they score a point. However, if an enemy space ships crosses over the border to the player's side, they will incur damage of 10 points and if an enemy ships hits the player's ship, the damage taken will be 5 points. 

Once the player scores more than 5, the game speeds up. Once the player has damage of more than 99, the game is over and this is shown wih a message box telling the user that they have been destroyed and they are given the option to play again
